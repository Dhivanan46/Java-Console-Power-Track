# Power-Track || Java Embedded
* A Hardware is designed to measure the power usage of individual appliances in real time and push the data to SQL DB.
* Power Track is a Java-based console application designed to help users monitor and manage the power consumption of their household or office appliances.
* The system allows users to register appliances, track real-time energy usage, set monthly power budgets, and receive alerts when consumption exceeds the defined limit.
* It also provides helpful suggestions to reduce power usage, promoting energy efficiency and cost savings.
* User can control the appliance(on/off) through telegram bot.
